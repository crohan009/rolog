> CoFEx is a probabilistic deep neural network model designed to extract features from code (any programming lauguage) by combining XLNet's laugage model (treating code as a natural language) and Gated-Graph Neural networks (treating code as a hierarchical graph), thereby bi-modally modelling code in order to create embeddings for programming languages for numerous applications such as code auto-completion, code prediction, bug detection and correction.
